ElysiumOS is a 64bit hobby operating system designed mainly by me (@WuX). Elysium currently only supports the x86_64 architecture, although support for Aarch64 is planned.

Repositories:
- [elysium](https://github.com/elysium-os/elysium) is the repository for the ElysiumOS distribution.
- [cronus](https://github.com/elysium-os/cronus) is the the kernel that powers Elysium.
- [tartarus-bootloader](https://github.com/elysium-os/tartarus-bootloader) is the bootloader that cronus uses.
